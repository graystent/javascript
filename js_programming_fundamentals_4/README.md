# Advanced Objects: Sugar Library

In this exercise we'll be creating some helpful extensions to the `Object` object in JavaScript, inspired by the [Sugar JavaScript library](https://sugarjs.com/docs/#/Object). Note

The aim of this exercise is to become more comfortable working with objects in JavaScript, specifically:

- Looping over objects
- Adding, modifying and removing key-value pairs
- Making copies of objects

In this exercise, the tests are already written for you. Take a good look at them, as they offer lots of demonstrations of more complex testing.

### Get started

1. First, **fork** and **clone** this repository onto your computer

2. `cd` into the new directory which is created

3. run `npm install` to install the dependencies

4. head over to [TASKS.md](./docs/TASKS.md) for instructions on how to complete the exercise

### Further work

If you want to extend this project in the future, perhaps to provide an additional item for your portfolio, take a look at other methods for Objects listed on the [Sugar documentation](https://sugarjs.com/docs/#/Object) and feel free to implement, and test, more methods of your choice.

Many of the functions have more advanced functionality than we have implemented here - feel free to read the documentation and extend your methods to be more powerful, using the Red-Green-Refactor development cycle.
