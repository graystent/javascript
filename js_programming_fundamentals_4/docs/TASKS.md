# Tasks

### Part 1: Advanced Objects

In class we will aim to solve `Object.size` and `Object.min`.

Then, continue with the following instructions

1. Make sure you understand the solutions to the first two functions

2. Take a look at the next function, `Object.max`. Think about the steps you will need to take to identify the maximum value in an object, and write the steps out in pseudocode.

3. Add a `.only` to the test for this function and run it with `npm test`, to see it fail (Red, Green, Refactor!):

4. Implement the code for this function.

5. Run the tests again, hopefully they now pass.

6. Continue this process for the remaining functions:

   - `clone`
   - `get`
   - `has`
   - `sum`
   - `invert`
   - `addAll`

### Part 2: Functions as values

There are only 3 functions to complete this week.

Implement the following functions using TDD:

- `find`
- `every`
- `some`

Remember that the tests are already written and will help you understand how the functions are intended to be used.
